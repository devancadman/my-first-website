# My First Cloud9 Project

This is the first project that I created in the Cloud9 editor. This project was created to display the technologies that I have learnt so far in this program, in a small little dashboard. The purpose of this is so that we get an understanding of how to find our way around the Cloud9 editor.

Check it out the Live deployment project here <b>: https://devancadman.github.io/my-first-website/</b>

## Technologies Used

In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, and we wrote our code using the Cloud9 IDE.
We then Hosted the site on Github Pages.
