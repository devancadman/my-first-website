#My First Cloud9 Project

This is the first project that I created in the Cloud9 editor. This project was created to display the technologies that I have learnt so far in this program, in a small little dashboard. The purpose of this is so that we get an understanding of how to find our way around the Cloud9 editor.

##Technologies Used

In this project we used some simple HTML5 and CSS3 to build the project, and we wrote our code using the Cloud9 IDE.
